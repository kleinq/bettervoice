**Feature**: 001-bettervoice-macos-voice
**Generated**: 2025-09-30
**Artifacts Analyzed**: spec.md (187 lines), plan.md (220 lines), tasks.md (637 lines), constitution.md (144 lines)

## Executive Summary

This READ-ONLY analysis examines consistency, completeness, and clarity across specification, implementation plan, and task breakdown before implementation begins. Analysis includes: duplication detection, ambiguity identification, coverage gaps, constitutional alignment, and cross-artifact inconsistencies.

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** with 8 minor clarifications recommended (none blocking)

---

## 1. Duplication Analysis

### 1.1 Requirement Duplication
**Status**: ✅ NO CRITICAL DUPLICATIONS FOUND

**Findings**:
- **FR-001** and **FR-002** are distinct (FR-001: audio capture, FR-002: hotkey trigger)
- **FR-014** (learning from edits) and **FR-015** (pattern matching) are complementary, not duplicates
- **PR-001** through **PR-008** cover different performance aspects with non-overlapping metrics
- **SR-001** through **SR-009** each address distinct security requirements

**Minor Overlap** (LOW):
- **FR-020** (cloud opt-in) and **UR-005** (explicit consent) - semantic overlap but FR-020 is technical, UR-005 is UX-focused → ACCEPTABLE

### 1.2 Task Duplication
**Status**: ✅ NO DUPLICATIONS FOUND

**Verification**:
- All 100 tasks (T001-T100) target unique file paths
- No two [P] (parallel) tasks modify the same file
- Test tasks (T006-T024) and implementation tasks (T025-T072) are correctly separated (TDD pattern)

---

## 2. Ambiguity Analysis

### 2.1 Requirements Ambiguity
**Status**: ⚠️ 4 MINOR AMBIGUITIES (All LOW severity)

| Requirement | Ambiguous Language | Impact | Severity |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| **PR-002** | "typical 30-second recording" | What defines "typical"? Audio quality, silence ratio, speech rate? | LOW |
| **FR-014** | "learn from user corrections" | How many edits constitute a pattern? 3? 5? 10? | LOW |
| **FR-028** | "maintain responsive UI" | What specific interactions must remain responsive during transcription? | LOW |
| **QR-003** | "handle poor audio gracefully" | What constitutes "poor audio"? SNR threshold? Volume threshold? | LOW |

**Recommendation**:
- Define "typical 30s audio" as: clear speech, <10% silence, normal speaking rate (140-160 wpm)
- Specify learning threshold: minimum 3 identical edits create a pattern
- List critical UI interactions: hotkey response, settings changes, menu bar clicks
- Define poor audio: SNR <10dB, volume <30% of device maximum, or >50% clipping

### 2.2 Technical Context Ambiguity
**Status**: ✅ NO AMBIGUITIES (All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved in research.md)

**Verified Resolutions**:
- Whisper.cpp integration approach: C++ bridge via Swift C interop ✅
- Hotkey handling: Carbon Events API with fallback to CGEvent monitoring ✅
- Database choice: GRDB.swift for SQLite with async/await support ✅
- Document type detection: Multi-strategy (app bundle ID + window title + heuristics) ✅

## 5. Inconsistency Analysis

### 5.1 Terminology Inconsistencies
**Status**: ✅ NO CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES

**Verified Consistency**:
- "AudioRecording" (model) vs "audio recording" (concept) - case-sensitive distinction is appropriate ✅
- "TranscriptionJob" consistently used across spec, plan, tasks ✅
- "Enhancement pipeline" vs "text enhancement" used interchangeably but clearly refer to same concept ✅
- "Cloud API" vs "External LLM" - both used, but LLM is more precise → Consider standardizing to "External LLM"

**Minor Inconsistency** (LOW):
- **spec.md** uses "whisper.cpp" (lowercase)
- **tasks.md** uses "WhisperService" (capitalized service name)
- **Recommendation**: Document convention: "whisper.cpp" for library, "WhisperService" for Swift wrapper

### 5.2 Scope Inconsistencies
**Status**: ⚠️ 1 MINOR GAP (LOW severity)

| Item | Spec Requirement | Task Coverage | Gap Description |
|------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Data export | **SR-007**: "Export functionality MUST allow users to extract their data" | Not explicitly in tasks.md | No task for export feature implementation |
| Model downloads | **FR-004**: "download models" | T042 (WhisperModelManager) | ✅ Covered |
| History viewing | **FR-012**: "view transcription history" | Implied in T061 (MenuBarView menu items) | ⚠️ No explicit history view task |

**Recommendations**:
1. Add task: "Implement data export feature (JSON/CSV) for transcription history and learning patterns"
2. Add task: "Implement history view window showing past transcriptions with search/filter"

### 5.3 Dependency Inconsistencies
**Status**: ✅ NO INCONSISTENCIES

**Verified**:
- Tasks.md dependency graph matches plan.md phase ordering ✅
- TDD discipline enforced: all tests (T006-T024) before implementation (T025+) ✅
- Integration phase (T073-T077) correctly depends on services (T039-T057) ✅
- Polish phase (T080-T100) correctly depends on integration completion ✅

## 6. Underspecified Analysis

### 6.1 Technical Underspecification
**Status**: ⚠️ 3 MINOR ITEMS (All LOW severity, non-blocking)

| Area | What's Underspecified | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|----------------------|---------|----------------|
| Waveform visualization algorithm | T071: "Real-time waveform visualization" - no algorithm specified | Developer choice during implementation | Document chosen algorithm (e.g., running average, FFT, peak detection) |
| Learning pattern confidence scoring | FR-014: "learn from corrections" - no confidence threshold specified | May over-apply or under-apply patterns | Define: confidence = min(3, editCount) / 3, apply patterns with confidence ≥0.67 |
| Cloud API retry logic | FR-021: "timeout" specified (30s), but no retry count | Single failure = permanent cloud enhancement failure | Specify: 2 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s) |
| Error message templates | UR-003: "user-friendly messages" - no template examples | Developer interpretation varies | Create error message style guide (see section 6.2) |

### 6.2 UX Underspecification
**Status**: ⚠️ 2 MINOR ITEMS (LOW severity)

| Area | What's Underspecified | Recommendation |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| Settings window size/position | T062 (SettingsWindow) specifies tabs but not dimensions | Suggest: 600x400pt minimum, remember last position via UserDefaults |
| Overlay fade-in/fade-out timing | T069-T070 (overlays) specify "pulse animation" but no duration | Suggest: 200ms fade-in, 300ms fade-out, 1.5s pulse cycle |

### 6.3 Data Model Underspecification
**Status**: ✅ NO CRITICAL UNDERSPECIFICATION

**Minor Item** (LOW):
- **TranscriptionJob.status** enum values not explicitly listed in data-model.md
- **Recommendation**: Document enum: `.pending`, `.transcribing`, `.enhancing`, `.completed`, `.failed`

---

## 9. Next Actions

### ✅ Recommended Before Implementation (Optional):

1. **Address 4 ambiguities** by adding clarifications to spec.md (estimated: 15 minutes)
   - Add "Definitions" section with "typical audio", "poor audio", "learning threshold", "critical UI interactions"

2. **Address 2 coverage gaps** by adding 2 tasks to tasks.md (estimated: 10 minutes)
   - **T101** [P]: Implement data export feature (CSV/JSON) for transcription history
   - **T102** [P]: Implement history view window with search/filter

3. **Address 2 underspecifications** by adding notes to tasks.md (estimated: 5 minutes)
   - T071: Add note suggesting waveform algorithm (running average recommended)
   - T050: Add note specifying retry logic (2 retries, exponential backoff)

**Total estimated time**: 30 minutes
**Impact**: Reduces developer questions during implementation, improves consistency

### ✅ PROCEED IMMEDIATELY (If desired):

The current artifacts are **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** without further changes. All 8 LOW-severity issues can be resolved during implementation through developer judgment. The 99.1% coverage score and constitutional compliance indicate excellent preparation.

---

## 10. Remediation Questions for User

**Question 1**: Do you want to address the 4 ambiguities now, or allow developers to use reasonable judgment during implementation?

**Question 2**: Should we add the 2 missing tasks (data export, history view) now, or defer them to a future feature increment after core functionality is complete?

**Question 3**: Proceed with implementation starting at T001 (project setup), or perform optional 30-minute refinement pass first?
