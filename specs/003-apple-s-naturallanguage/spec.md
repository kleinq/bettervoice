# Feature Specification: NaturalLanguage Framework Text Classifier

**Feature Branch**: `003-apple-s-naturallanguage`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Apple's NaturalLanguage Framework (Built-in, Fast)
Use NLModel with a custom-trained CreateML text classifier for basic classification based on text content. Benefits:
✅ Completely on-device (privacy)
✅ Fast inference (<10ms)
✅ No external dependencies
✅ Works offline
✅ Low memory footprint
Approach:
Train a CreateML Text Classifier with labeled examples
Categories: email, message, document (formal), social, code, search
Use text features like:
Sentence structure (fragments vs complete sentences)
Formality indicators (greetings, signatures, technical terms)
Length patterns
Punctuation density"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When dictated text contains conflicting formality signals (e.g., starts casual "Hey" but becomes formal), how should the system classify? → A: Dominant characteristics - classify based on which signals appear most frequently across the entire text
- Q: Should the system provide a confidence score with each classification, and what should happen when confidence is low? → A: No confidence score - always return single definitive classification (simplest UX)
- Q: Should classification results be stored/logged, and if so, for what purpose? → A: Store for model improvement - log classifications to enable future model retraining with real usage data
- Q: Can users manually override or correct classifications when the system gets it wrong? → A: No override - system classification is final, user cannot change it
- Q: What's the acceptable accuracy threshold for the classification model in production? → A: 80% accuracy - acceptable for MVP/initial release, focus on speed over precision

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a voice-to-text user, I need the system to automatically detect what type of content I'm dictating (email, message, document, social post, code, or search query) so that the text enhancement can apply appropriate formatting, tone, and structure without me having to manually specify the context every time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I dictate "Hey Sarah comma are we still on for lunch today question mark", **When** the system processes the transcription, **Then** it classifies the text as "message" based on informal greeting, recipient name, and casual question structure
2. **Given** I dictate "Dear hiring manager comma I am writing to express my interest in the position period", **When** the system analyzes the text, **Then** it classifies as "email" or "document (formal)" based on formal salutation and professional structure
3. **Given** I dictate "function calculate total open paren items close paren open brace", **When** the system processes technical syntax markers, **Then** it classifies as "code" based on programming keywords and structure
4. **Given** I dictate "Just shipped our new feature exclamation love seeing users respond", **When** the system analyzes the informal, brief, enthusiastic tone, **Then** it classifies as "social" based on brevity and casual expression
5. **Given** I dictate "weather in San Francisco", **When** the system processes the short, query-like structure, **Then** it classifies as "search" based on absence of complete sentence structure
6. **Given** I dictate a 500-word formal paragraph with complete sentences and professional vocabulary, **When** the system analyzes formality indicators and structure, **Then** it classifies as "document (formal)"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dictation contains mixed signals (starts casual but becomes formal)?
  - System classifies based on dominant characteristics across the entire text (whichever formality signals appear most frequently)
- How does the system handle very short dictations (1-3 words) where context is minimal?
  - System still returns single definitive classification based on available features, no minimum length threshold
- What happens when the user dictates content that doesn't fit any category clearly?
  - System returns single best-match classification without presenting alternatives or uncertainty indicators
- How does the system handle multi-language dictation or code-switching?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should classification work across languages or only English? How should mixed-language content be classified?]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically classify dictated text into one of six predefined categories: email, message, document (formal), social, code, or search
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze text features including sentence structure, formality indicators, technical terms, length patterns, and punctuation density
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform classification within 10 milliseconds of receiving transcribed text to ensure real-time responsiveness
- **FR-004**: System MUST operate completely offline without requiring network connectivity for classification
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve user privacy by processing all text classification on-device without transmitting data externally
- **FR-006**: Classification model MUST be trained using labeled example text for each of the six categories
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect sentence completeness (complete sentences vs fragments) as a classification feature
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify formality indicators such as greetings, signatures, salutations, and professional terminology
- **FR-009**: System MUST analyze text length and structure patterns characteristic of each content type
- **FR-010**: System MUST evaluate punctuation usage density and patterns as classification signals
- **FR-011**: System MUST return a single definitive classification without confidence scores or uncertainty indicators
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist classification results to enable future model retraining with real usage data
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT allow users to manually override or correct classifications (system classification is final)
- **FR-014**: System MUST achieve minimum 80% classification accuracy in production (acceptable for MVP/initial release)
- **FR-015**: System MUST classify based on dominant characteristic signals when text contains mixed or conflicting formality indicators
- **FR-016**: System MUST support English-language text classification only in MVP (multi-language support deferred to future iteration)

### Key Entities
- **Text Classification**: Represents the categorization result for a piece of dictated text, containing the assigned category (email/message/document/social/code/search) and timestamp; persisted for future model retraining
- **Training Example**: Represents labeled sample text used to train the classification model, containing the text content, assigned category, and characteristic features
- **Text Features**: Represents extracted characteristics from dictated text including sentence structure metrics, formality scores, technical term presence, length statistics, and punctuation patterns
- **Classification Category**: Represents one of the six supported content types with associated characteristic patterns and decision criteria
- **Classification Log**: Represents stored classification history containing original text, assigned category, timestamp, and extracted features for model retraining purposes
